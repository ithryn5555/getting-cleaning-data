# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The dataset being used is: [Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

## Files

The code assumes all the data is present in the same folder without changes from the original.

`run_analysis.R` contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps and can be executed from within RStudio.

The output of the 5th step is called `tidy_data.txt` and is included in this repository.

## Documentation

`CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data.
